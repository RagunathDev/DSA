# 🧩 DSA – For Every Day

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice Repository** 🎯  
Here I solve **LeetCode / coding problems** every day to sharpen my skills and stay consistent.  

---

## 📌 About This Repo
- 🚀 Focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- 💡 Problems from **LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GFG**  
- 📝 Languages used: `JavaScript` (primary), sometimes `Python`  
- 🔄 Updated **daily** (or at least consistently)  

---

## 🔥 Why This Repo?
I believe in **small daily progress** → over time, it compounds into big results.  
This repo is not just about coding—it’s about **discipline, problem-solving, and growth**.  

---
## 🌱 Goals
- [x] Solve 100+ DSA problems consistently  
- [ ] Master common **patterns** (sliding window, two pointers, recursion, DP, graphs)  
- [ ] Prepare for **FAANG-level interviews**  

---

## 📊 Progress
I’ll keep pushing daily commits to track my journey.  
Stay tuned 📌

✨ *Consistency beats intensity. Solving one problem daily keeps me sharp for the long run!*
